Z dies from the \\neffects the several doses of poiso n so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the \\ncommission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty \\nof the offence though their acts are separate. \\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours \\nat a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally \\nomitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. \\nZ dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z. \\n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to \\nsupply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in  strength, but the starvation is not \\nsufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or \\ncooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s \\ndeath. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an \\nattempt to commit murder. \\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be \\nguilty of different offences by means of that act. \\nIllustration. \\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only \\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill -will towards Z and intending to kill him, and \\nnot having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged \\nin causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide. \\nCHAPTER II \\nOF PUNISHMENTS \\n4.

Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\nIllustration. \\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by.

Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm .—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause \\nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of \\npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that \\nit was likely to cause harm. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself \\nin such a position that,  before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty \\nor thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his \\ncourse, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passeng ers on board, which he may \\npossibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith \\nfor the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \\nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be \\nfound as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in \\nincurring the risk of running down the boat C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading.

Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent .—Nothing is an offence by \\nreason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even \\nwithout that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify \\nconsent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful \\ncharge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: \\nProvided that this exception shall not extend to— \\n(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death; \\n(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death , for any \\npurpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or \\ninfirmity; \\n(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than \\nthe preventing of death or hurt; \\n(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. \\nIllustrations. \\n(1) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. \\nA, not intending Z’s death, but in good faith, for  Z’s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his \\npower of judging for himself. A has committed no offence. \\n(2) Z is carried off by a tiger.

A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n(3) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be \\nimmediately performed.

Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of \\nordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. \\nOf right of private defence \\n34.

Right of private defence against act of a person of unsound mind, etc .—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason  of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of \\nany misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against \\nthat act which he would have if the act were that offence. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) Z, a person of unsound mind, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same \\nright of private defence which he would have if Z were sane. \\n(b) A enters by night a house  which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a \\nhouse-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A \\nhas the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not  acting under that \\nmisconception. \\n37.

Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although \\nthe abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offen ce of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should \\nbe committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. \\nA is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. \\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing \\nan offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any \\nguilty intention or knowledge. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which \\nwould be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the \\nsame intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a chil d under seven years of age, to do an act \\nwhich causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby \\ncauses Z’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be \\npunished in  the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had \\ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling -house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, \\nbeing incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets \\nfire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of \\nabetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelli ng-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that \\noffence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of \\nZ’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the p roperty out of Z’s \\npossession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not \\ntake dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the \\nsame punishment as if B had committed theft. \\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \\nalso an offence. \\nIllustration. \\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that \\noffence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment \\nfor murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission o f the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.

B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. \\nA is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n(b) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers \\nit to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to \\nZ in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that \\noffence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n50. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of \\nabettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for \\nthe offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge \\nof the abettor and with no other. \\n51. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as \\nif he had directly abetted it: \\nProvided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under \\nthe influence of  the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \\nabetment. \\n ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n(c) A instigates B and C to break  into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of \\nthe inmates, murder Z.

Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done .—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under section 51 is committed in addition to the act abetted, and consti tute \\na distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\nIllustration. \\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that \\ndistress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. \\nAs B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing \\ngrievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew that B was li kely \\nvoluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress, A will also be liable to punishment for each of \\nthe offences. \\n53. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by act abetted different from that intended by \\nabettor.—When an act is abetted wi th the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that \\nthe act abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\nIllustration. \\nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt \\nto Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is \\nliable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder. \\n54. Abettor present when offence is committed .—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n55. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life .—Whoever abets the \\ncommission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, shall, if that offence be not \\ncommitted in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made under this Sanhita for the \\npunishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may \\nextend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if any act for which the abettor is liable in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\nIllustration. \\nA instigates B to murder Z.

But it \\nmay amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been \\nbrought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n101. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,— \\n(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or  \\n(b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury \\nas the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or \\n(c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to \\nany person and the bodily injury intende d to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature \\nto cause death; or \\n(d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it is so imminently \\ndangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, \\nand commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as \\naforesaid. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him.

Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, \\nalthough the blow might not have been suffici ent in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a \\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him \\nsuch a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, \\nalthough he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, \\nor such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword -cut or club -wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the \\nordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have \\nintended to cause Z’s death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is \\nguilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of            \\nself-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or \\ncauses the death of any other person by mistake or accident: \\nProvided that the provocation is not,— \\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killin g or doing harm to any \\nperson; \\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise \\nof the powers of such public servant; \\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of \\nthe child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither \\nintending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here \\nA has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. \\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, \\nand kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public \\nservant in the exercise of his powers. \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A’s \\ndeposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. \\nThis is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to \\nprevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. \\nThis is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of \\nprivate defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited  to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take \\nadvantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z \\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right o f defence without premeditation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration. \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. \\nZ persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from \\nbeing horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill -will towards the person whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offen der’s having taken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\nassault. \\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration. \\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he \\nwas incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n102.

Force.—A person is said to use force to another if  he causes motion, change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other’s body, or with \\nanything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects \\nthat other’s sense of feeling: \\nProvided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, causes that \\nmotion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the following three ways, namely:— \\n(a) by his own bodily power; \\n(b) by disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of motion \\ntakes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person; \\n(c) by inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n129. Criminal force .—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person’s \\nconsent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending  by the use of such force to cause, or \\nknowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person \\nto whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes \\nthe boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing \\nsubstances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other action on any person’s part. A \\nhas therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s consent, in order to the \\ncommitting of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here \\nA has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used \\nforce to Z; and if A has done this without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may \\nthereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops th e palanquin. Here A \\nhas caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used \\nforce to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an \\noffence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his \\nown person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he \\nhas done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten \\nor annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into \\ncontact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up \\nthe water against Z’s clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the \\neffect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z’s clothes, A has used force to Z, and if \\nhe did so without Z’s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so \\nwithout her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, \\nhe has used criminal force to her.

Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or \\nannoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z. \\n130. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that \\ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault.

A has committed an assault. \\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may \\nthereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z.

Theft.—(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession \\nof any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to \\ncommit theft. \\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the ear th, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the \\nearth. \\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft. \\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented \\nit from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession,  or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z’s \\npossession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has \\ncommitted theft. \\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if A’s intention \\nbe dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A has committed thef t as soon \\nas Z’s dog has begun to follow A. \\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order \\nthat he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft \\nof the treasure. \\n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the \\nplate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft. \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z sh all return. A \\ncarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It could not therefore \\nbe taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal \\nbreach of trust. \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s \\npossession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits \\nno theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the \\nring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly \\nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and \\nselling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jewel er, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the \\njeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop \\nopenly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though h e may have \\ncommitted criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done \\ndishonestly.

Here A takes dishonestly; A has \\ntherefore committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book \\nwithout Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. \\nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this \\nwas A’s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to \\nZ her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If \\nthis was A’s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her \\nhusband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property \\ndishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out \\nof Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term \\nwhich may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent \\nconviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term \\nwhich shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years and with fine: \\nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees, \\nand a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value of property or restoration of the \\nstolen property, shall be punished with community service. \\n304. Snatching.—(1) Theft is snatching if, in order to commit theft, the offender suddenly or quickly \\nor forcibly seizes or secures or grabs or takes away from any person or from his possession any movable \\nproperty. \\n(2) Whoever commits snatching, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term \\nwhich may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine. \\n305.

A \\ncommits forgery. \\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable \\nand authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills  up the cheque by inserting the sum of                 \\ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority, intending to \\ndiscount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to ta ke up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A \\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, \\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n(f) Z’s will contains these words —“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided \\nbetween A, B and C. ” A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be believed that the \\nwhole was left to himself and C.

A has \\ncommitted forgery. \\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named            \\nby Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to  his instructions, induces Z to \\nsign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is a man of \\ngood character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intendi ng by means of such \\nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons.

Contents of charge.—(1) Every charge under this Sanhita shall state the offence with which the \\naccused is charged. \\n(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the \\ncharge by that name only. \\n(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of \\nthe offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. \\n(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to hav e been committed shall be \\nmentioned in the charge. \\n(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal  condition required by \\nlaw to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. \\n(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court. \\n(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such previous \\nconviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent offence, and it \\nis intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court \\nmay think fit, to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous conviction shall \\nbe stated in  the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before  \\nsentence is passed. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell  within the \\ndefinition of murder given in sections 100 and 101 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023; that it did not fall \\nwithin any of the general exceptions of the said Sanhita;  and that it did not fall within any of the five \\nexceptions to section 101 thereof, or that, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos \\nto that exception applied to it. \\n(b) A is charged under sub -section ( 2) of section 118 of the Bharatiya Nyaya  Sanhita, 2023, with \\nvoluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for  shooting. This is equivalent to a \\nstatement that the case was not provided for by sub-section (2) of section 122 of the said Sanhita, and that \\nthe general exceptions did not apply to it. \\n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-\\nmark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or  cheating, or theft, or extortion, or criminal \\nintimidation, or that he used a false propertymark,  without reference to the definitions, of those crimes \\ncontained in the Bharatiya Nyaya  Sanhita, 2023; but the sections under which the offence is punishable \\nmust, in each instance be referred to in the charge. \\n(d) A is charged under section 219 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with intentionally obstructing \\na sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those \\nwords. \\n235. Particulars as to time, place and person .—(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to \\nthe time and place of the  alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom , or the thing (if any) in \\nrespect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the  matter \\nwith which he is charged. \\n(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money \\nor other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the  gross sum or, as the case may be, describe \", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

When manner of committing offence must be stated.—When the nature of the case is such that \\nthe particulars mentioned in sections 234 and 235 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter \\nwith which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged \\noffence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out \\nthe manner in which the theft was effected. \\n(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which \\nA cheated B. \\n(c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion \\nof the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false. \\n(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public  functions at a given \\ntime and place. The charge must set out the manner in which  A obstructed B in the discharge of his \\nfunctions. \\n(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in \\nwhich A murdered B. \\n(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge \\nmust set out the disobedience charged and the law infringed. \\n237. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable .—In every charge \\nwords used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sen se attached to them \\nrespectively by the law under which such offence is punishable. \\n238. Effect of errors.—No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in \\nthe charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particul ars, shall be regarded at any  stage of the \\ncase as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission,  and it has occasioned a \\nfailure of justice. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A is charged under section 180 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , 2023, with “having been in \\npossession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin \\nwas counterfeit,” the word “fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact \\nmisled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material. \\n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or \\nis set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The \\nCourt may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. \\n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out  in the charge. \\nThere were many transactions between A and B , and A had no means of  knowing to which of them the \\ncharge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer  from such facts that the omission to set out \\nthe manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.

A was never \\ncharged with any murder but one, and had heard the  inquiry before the Magistrate, which referr ed \\nexclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and \\nthat the error in the charge was immaterial. \\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and  Khoda Baksh (who \\ntried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 2023. When  charged for the murder of Haidar \\nBaksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The  witnesses present in his defence were witnesses \\nin the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court  may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was \\nmaterial. \\n239. Court may alter charge .—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before \\njudgment is pronounced. \\n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused. \\n(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with  the trial is not \\nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct \\nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with \\nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge. \\n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion \\nof the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial \\nor adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. \\n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the pros ecution of which previous \\nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction \\nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge \\nis founded. \\n240. Recall of witnesses when charge altered.—Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court \\nafter the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed— \\n(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness \\nwho may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to  be recorded in writing, considers that \\nthe prosecutor or the accused, as the case may  be, desires to recall or re -examine such witness for the \\npurpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice; \\n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material. \\nB.—Joinder of charges \\n241.

Evasive-denial.— Where  a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the pla int, he must not do so \\nevasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus,  if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of  \\nmoney, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he r eceived that particular amount, but he must deny th at he \\nreceived that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is m ade \\nwith diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances. \\n5. Specific denial .— 1[( 1)] Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not d enied specifically or by \\nnecessary implication, or stated to be not admitted  in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken t o be \\nadmitted except as against a person under disability: \\nProvided that the Court may in its discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than  \\nby such admission: \\n*[Provided further that every allegation of fact in  the plaint, if not denied in the manner provided \\nunder Rule 3A of this Order, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability.] \\n2[( 2) Where the defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be lawful for the court to pronounce \\njudgment on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but \\nthe Court may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved. \\n(3) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to  sub-rule ( 1) or under sub-rule ( 2), the Court shall \\nhave due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader. \\n(4) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule , a decree shall be drawn up in accordance \\nwith such judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.] \\n6.

B dies and D takes out  administration \\nto B's effects, C pays Rs, 1,000 as surety for D; t hen D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the d ebt of Rs. 1,000 \\nagainst the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the s ame character with respect to the legacy as they fi ll with respect to \\nthe payment of the Rs. 1,000. \\n(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out ad ministration to A’s effects and B buys part of the effects from C. \\nIn a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, th e latter cannot set-off the debt against the price,  for C fills \\ntwo different characters, one as the vendor to B, i n which he sues B, and the other as representative to A. \\n(c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A ha s wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is li able to him in \\ncompensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. \\n(d)  A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds  a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000.
